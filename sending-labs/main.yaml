      SendingNetwork, a project under DePIN, endeavors to decentralize
      communications through the development of a novel Transmission Control
      Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack. TCP/IP serves as a foundational
      set of protocols governing internet communication, enabling seamless data
      transmission across devices. By decentralizing this infrastructure,
      SendingNetwork aims to enhance the resilience, security, and privacy of
      digital communications.
