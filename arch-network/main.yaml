      Arch Network is a bitcoin-native application platform that introduces
      smart contract functionality directly into Bitcoin through a novel
      architecture. It leverages a Rust-based zero-knowledge virtual machine,
      known as the ArchVM, along with a decentralized verifier network,
      collectively referred to as the Arch Network. The ArchVM is inspired by
      SVM (Single Virtual Machine) and is designed for parallel execution,
      incorporating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for transaction verification.
