      Hyperbridge is a cross-chain protocol that uses cryptographic proofs to
      create a decentralized and permissionless network of relayers, enabling
      secure transmission of messages across blockchain networks. The relayers
      do not require whitelisting or staking and are incentivized by user fees
      for performing cross-chain operations. Acting as a cryptoeconomic
      coprocessor, Hyperbridge provides secure, verifiable interoperability
      using consensus and storage proofs. Developers can use on-chain and
      off-chain SDKs to send and read cross-chain messages, enhancing blockchain
      interoperability.
